    <h1>MAP672: Programming for Web Mapping</h1>
    <h2>Map Portfolio by Amber J. Bosse</h2>
    
</header>
    <p>Amber J. Bosse, PhD student at the University of Kentucky Department of Geography and soon to be programming ninja, GitHub warrior, and creator of wicked awesome web-maps, has created some maps she wants you to see.While a portfolio typically highlights the best and brightest of moments in your work,this portfolio shows the evolution of Amber's web-mapping skill-sets, highlighting the advancements shes made while being a student in the New Maps Plus MAP 672 course. Many (all?) off these maps are pretty ugly, but thats not the point. So, what is the point? Well...just  don't worry about that now. Amber just doesn't want you to give her crap about her ugly maps, okay?! She's doing the best she can. Programming is hard work! Anyways, scroll down to view the fruits of her efforts.</p>

    <p>Amber's first major engagment with web-mapping took place during a participatory action mapping project with a community organization based in West Atlanta. This organization, called the Westside Atlanta Land Trust, wanted to take advantage of their non-profit ArcGIS Online account and make a web map that shows the conditions of the housing stock in their neighborhood. As such, I used ArcMap to build a database which could then be populated using ArcGIS collector mobile application. The point symbols on this map are the result of the countless hours of resident performed data collection. </p>
